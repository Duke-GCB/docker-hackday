## What's the deal with docker and containers?

- **Docker**: software and services that make it easy to use **Linux Containers** to run **applications**.
- Docker and containers are not the same thing.
- Docker = Containers + Tools & Services

---

## Use Cases

Generally: 

> I want to run some application

- Open-source service like Apache or Postgres
- Web application consisting of several services (Mediawiki, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- A Bioinformatics tool
- Some python script that uses scientific computing packages

---

## You can

1. Install linux on a server
2. Install the base packages you need (that might get you apache or postgres)
    - Maybe you're using ansible for a fleet of servers, great!
3. Install and configure the application
    - Dependencies, config files, etc
    - Connections to other services (firewall, networking, etc)
4. Configure access to the data (mount NFS or CIFS)

---

## Decisions, Decisions

You decided:

- How many services per server, how many servers. (scalability)
- Base OS. Software and libraries to use (dependencies)
- How data is input (network share?, copy once? database?)
- Where data is output (logs? results?)
- User permissions and access

Did you make a special snowflake or a set of building blocks?

## My Docker Philosophy

Divorce code, configuration and data

1. Freeze all code into a read-only image. (1-3)
  - Image is runnable like a Live CD or a video game cartridge
  - Base OS, dependencies, and applications.
  - Identifiable and versioned.
2. What's left is either configuration or data
  - Decide what's disposable, what's important user data.

**Cattle, not pets**

# Images, Containers, and Volumes
*oh my*

---

## Images
- Images are immutable, WORM. Like burning a CD (faster).<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Consider a Live CD or Rescue Disk<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Dockerfile is the recipe <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Once you've got a working image, it's frozen!<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Need a different image? throw it away and build a new one.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - Don't try to upgrade a library. Make a new image with the new library.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- Lots of official images and good tooling for building your own<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## Containers
- You start a container from an image<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Containers are alive, images are dead.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Provides an OS, but shares kernel with host<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Guidelines:<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - should be single-purpose (maybe single-process)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
  - should be disposable<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

# Why?
- Efficiency. 100s of containers per host<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Isolation. Similar to a VM<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Scalability. Encourages scalable practices, separate web from db<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Continuous Integration/Deployment. Dev->Test->Prod automatically<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Dependency Hell. Everything or nothing<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Performance. But be aware of the filesystem<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

A lot of these are about separating code from data.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

# How
- **VOLUME**s
  - Cuts a hole to the host
  - data volumes: `-v /log` 
    - persists on host
  - host volumes: `-v /home/dcl9/mydata:/mydata` 
    - mounted from the host
- **ENV** variables 
  - Pass in configuration info
- **docker compose**
  - Specify multiple services that _compose_ an application
  - Docker handles the scaling and networking

---

# Focus areas

Containers have many applications

- Web or other service applications
  - Containers running in the cloud
  - Scalability, Deployment, DevOps
- Computational workflows
  - Images used to capture and prescribe computing environments
  - Tooling used to connect data flow and processing
- Administration tools
  - Avoid installing software on your servers
  - Just run a container for a specific task with elevated privileges

---

# Other Areas

- Security and user access
- Volumes / plugins
- Clusters / swarm
- Orchestration / compose
- Networking
- Registry
